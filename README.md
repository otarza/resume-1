## Summary

I am technology agnostic software developer. In my role as the co-founder of uniHack, we have organised the biggest college hackathons in the Caucasian region. In addition to this, I'm driving local developer communities and organizing meetups which allows me to bring together a group of people who share the love of creating. I started coding when I was 15 and during my career I have gained a lot experience as a Front-End Web developer. However, I also possess substantial experience as an Android, iOS, and Drupal Developer. I am interested in Functional, Dataflow and Reactive Programming. I have worked on project which serve thousands of users and operate on big data. I am passionate about building high quality applications and user interfaces with modern web technologies.  In my free time I enjoy contributing to open source projects, experimenting with physics simulations and audio visualisations, reading, listening to music and biking in cities or countryside.
