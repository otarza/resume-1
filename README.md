## Summary

I am technology agnostic software developer. I started coding when I was 15 and during my career I have gained a lot experience as a Front-End Web developer. However, I also possess substantial experience as an Android, iOS, and Drupal Developer. I am interested in Functional, Dataflow and Reactive Programming. I have worked on projects which serve thousands of users and operate on big data.

In my role as the co-founder of uniHack, I have organised the biggest college hackathons in the Caucasian region. In addition to this, I'm driving local developer communities and organizing meetups which allows me to bring together a group of people who share the love of creating.

I am passionate about building high quality applications and user interfaces with modern web technologies. In my free time I enjoy contributing to open source projects, experimenting with physics simulations and audio visualisations, reading, listening to music and biking in cities or countryside.
